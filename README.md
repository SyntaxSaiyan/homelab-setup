# My Homelab Setup

Welcome to my homelab documentation!  
This environment is where I experiment with IT infrastructure, cybersecurity tools, networking, and automation.  
The goal of this lab is to **learn by building, breaking, and securing real-world services**.

---

## **🏗️ Hardware Overview**
- **Ubiquiti USG** – Firewall, VPN  
- **Synology NAS** – Private cloud storage & backups  
- **Raspberry Pi 4** – Running as a UniFi Cloud Key  
- **Netgear 24-Port 1Gb Switch** – Core network connectivity  
- **Lenovo ThinkCentre Workstation** – Running **Proxmox VE** for virtualization

## **🖥️ Virtualized Services (via Proxmox)**
- **Pi-hole** – Network-wide ad blocking & DNS filtering  
- **Home Assistant** – Smart home & automation  
- **Tor Relay** – Contributing to online privacy/anonymity
- **Wazuh(in a container)** – Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) 
Proxmox (bare metal) → VM (Ubuntu) → Docker containers (Wazuh stack).
Each layer provides isolation and makes things easier to manage:
    Want to upgrade Wazuh? Just replace the Docker containers.
    Want to snapshot the entire Wazuh environment? Just snapshot the VM.
    If something breaks, you’re not messing with your Proxmox host.

---

## **🛠️ Why This Setup?**
- Hands-on practice with **firewalls, VPNs, and DNS** for cybersecurity.  
- Learning **virtualization and containerization** using Proxmox.  
- Building automation workflows with **Home Assistant**.  
- Gaining experience with **network monitoring and ad-blocking** (Pi-hole).  

---

## **🚀 Future Plans**
- Deploy a **SIEM solution** (e.g., Wazuh or ELK Stack).  
- Add **Docker containers** for additional services (e.g., Nextcloud).  
- Set up a **Vulnerability Scanner** (e.g., OpenVAS).  
- Improve network segmentation and security policies.

## **💡 Lessons Learned**
I use this repo as a log of experiments, challenges, and solutions I’ve found while maintaining the lab. It's essentially a playground that I get to use to learn and experiment with new technologies.
